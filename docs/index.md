# ZITADEL Provider

This provider allows the management of different resources on a ZITADEL instance.

Through this provider it is possible to interact with the [ZITADEL API](https://docs.zitadel.com/docs/apis/introduction) to configure different aspects of the instance.

## Configuring the provider

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zitadel = {
      source  = "zitadel/zitadel"
      version = "1.0.0-alpha.1"
    }
  }
}

provider zitadel {
  domain = "localhost:8080"
  insecure = "true"
  project = "170832731415117995"
  token   = "local-token"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `domain` (String)
- `insecure` (Boolean)
- `project` (String)
- `token` (String)

## Limitations

The token which is used to connect to ZITADEL is currently limited to JWT-token for serviceaccounts, so you have to create a service account first, to download the key from this.
