    Provider to manage resources on ZITADEL

---

# {{ .ProviderShortName | upper }} Provider

This provider allows the management of different resources on a ZITADEL instance.

Through this provider it is possible to interact with the [ZITADEL API](https://docs.zitadel.com/docs/apis/introduction) to configure different aspects of the instance.

## Configuring the provider

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Limitations

The token which is used to connect to ZITADEL is currently limited to JWT-token for serviceaccounts, so you have to create a service account first, to download the key from this.
